# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML skills by building a simple recipe website. It demonstrates the following:

- Creating structured HTML documents
- Linking between pages using relative file paths
- Using lists, headings, paragraphs, and images
- Organizing files into folders

At the end of this project, I will have a better understanding of:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Building multi-page sites
- Managing folders and files like a developer
